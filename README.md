# School_21 (Ecole_42)

This repository was created to upload my projects while studying at School 21 (Ecole 42).

Each project has a serial number that tells when the project was completed.  
Each project has an attached file with the subject.  
All projects are coded with the coding rules of School 21 (Norminette).

( ! ) <ins>Sometimes the structure of the code may look strange,  
this is caused by the coding rules of School 21</ins> (e.g. no more than 25 lines for one function etc.).
