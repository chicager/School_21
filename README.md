## This repository was created to upload my projects while studying at *School_21 (Ecole_42)*.

* Each project has a serial number that tells when the project was completed.  
* Each project has an attached file with the subject.  
* All C language projects are coded with the coding rules of School 21 (<a href="./norme.pdf">Norminette</a>).<br/>
* All C++ language projects are coded with a project's restrictions. Pls see a project's subject file for getting info.<br/>
* All projects are coded on MacOS and I cannot guarantee that it will work on other OS.

[‚ùó] <ins>**Sometimes the structure of the code may look strange,  
this is caused by the coding rules of School 21</ins> (e.g. no more than 25 lines for one function etc.).**
